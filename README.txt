This project is provides the GoldenGATE Server Core, components for user
management and remote event handling, GoldenGATE Server Web Front-end core,
modules for online user management, a GoldenGATE Editor plugin for centralized
authentication against a GoldenGATE Server, as well as many unitilty and
convenience classes for building server components and web front-end servlets
and modules.


This project requires the JAR files build by the Ant script in the idaho-core
project (http://code.google.com/p/idaho-core/) and the JAR files referenced from
there. See http://code.google.com/p/idaho-core/source/browse/README.txt for the
latter. You can either check out idaho-core as a project into the same workspace
and build it first, or include the JAR files it generates in the "lib" folder.

The GoldenGATE Editor plug-ins further depend on the goldengate-editor project
(http://code.google.com/p/goldengate-editor/) and the JAR files referenced from
there. See http://code.google.com/p/goldengate-editor/source/browse/README.txt
for the latter. If neither of the goldengate-editor project and the GoldenGATE.jar
it builds into are avaliable, the build as a whole won't fail, only the GoldenGATE
Editor plug-ins won't be created.
